# task-tracker-py
Task tracker created using python\
*Scrapping this version to make a version that runs via CLI commands*\
*Keeping this project active to steal components but may eventually close the repository*\
*Either way I will not be putting any further work into this project*\
\
tasks.json is in the repository as an example of the intended output\
tasks.json.bkup is a backup of tasks.json that was being used when the script kept deleting the contents of tasks.json and I got tired of rewriting it\
(I kept it around because I'm paranoid that my stupidity will strike again)\
test.py is just a file for testing out concepts I'm unfamiliar with\
(Felt easier than testing it out within the script itself)\
